Hello there,

My name is Darius Chirila and I am a 25 year old aspiring web developer currently based in the Charlotte, NC area.

I've always had an interest in the field of technology, even as a young child but never really broke into it until November of 2020. I used to design my own websites when I was 12 as a hobby and it was really fun! I also was always intrigued at the idea of learning to program and creating my own projects. The world of technology always fascinated me.

Since I started my journey into this field, I've become familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript (the basics of course) and am now learning React JS and building my own web applications! My goal is to start working as a React developer soon and maybe get into Mobile App. development. I am super excited to be diving into this field and for all the things I will learn and create.
